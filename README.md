Please Turn Off the Lights is a puzzle game where Anabelle, the player, is trying to turn off multiple lights in a dimly lit room before going to sleep. In the shadows lurk strange creatures that are trying to harm the player on their mission. As more lights are turned off, the monsters can move around more, but the player will also be closer to winning.

Use Arrow Keys to move and Space to interact with lights
